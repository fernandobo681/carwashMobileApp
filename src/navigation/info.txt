The navigation folder is where you will keep all of the code 
related to navigation in your application. This includes the 
stacks, types, routes, and any other components or functions 
needed to support navigation.

By having all of your navigation code in a centralized location,
it makes it easier to manage and maintain it, as well as reducing
the risk of code duplication and making it easier to share navigation 
functionality across different parts of your application.
