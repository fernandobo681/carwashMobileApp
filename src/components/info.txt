The components folder is where you will keep all of your reusable components. 
These components should be isolated and not specific to any particular feature or domain. 
Examples of these types of components include headers, buttons, and list items.

Keeping these components separate from your feature-specific components
makes it easier to manage and reuse them throughout your application and 
reduces the amount of duplication in your code.
