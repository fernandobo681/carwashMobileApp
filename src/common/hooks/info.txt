The hooks folder is where you will keep any custom hooks that 
are used throughout your application. A hook is a special type 
of function in React that allows you to reuse stateful logic 
across your components.

Having all of your reusable/used in multiple places custom hooks
in a centralized location makes it easier to manage and maintain them,
as well as reducing the risk of code duplication and making it easier
to share hooks across different parts of your application.
