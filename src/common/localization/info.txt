The localization folder is where you will keep all of the files 
related to internationalization in your application. 
This includes language files, string constants, and any other 
resources needed to support multiple languages in your application.

Having these files in a centralized location, it makes it easier 
to manage and maintain them, as well as reducing the risk of code 
duplication and making it easier to support multiple languages in your application.
