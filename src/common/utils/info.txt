Utility functions can be an important part of your React Native application,
as they provide a way to reuse code that can be used in multiple parts of
your application. The utils folder in your application is a great place 
to store utility functions that are used throughout your application. 
By centralizing these functions in one location, you can ensure that they
are easy to find and use in other parts of your code. For example: 
react-native layout related utility functions.
